					<h5 class="lead text-center">My Training Philosophy</h5>
					<p>As your trainer, my objective is to assist you in accomplishing your distance 
						running goals.  Although my focus is on training individuals for the half and full 
						marathon, I am also capable and delighted to work with individuals who may be 
						considering a move up to the 10K distance from 5K or, for that matter, figuring 
						out how to get a good start in running.  Ultimately, I wish to provide you with 
						the habits to maintain good health, a high quality of life, and promote distance 
						running as a lifelong activity.  
					</p>

					<p> An individual's training program should be a process that can be enjoyed and 
						also provide the preparation needed to complete a targeted event.  The key to 
						achieving your goals as a distance runner is to focus on the training process.  I 
						will provide you with an educational and positive training experience that will 
						keep you participating.

					<h5 class="text-center lead">Why Might You Consider A Trainer</h5>
					<p>There are a number of reasons an individual would obtain a trainer's 
						assistance.  A trainer can provide the needed structure or 
						direction in your training.  They provide the needed variety of training 
						activities to help you achieve your goals, and act as a supervisor to the 
						training and encouragement needed to stay the course.  
						Hiring a trainer is a commitment that you are making to yourself 
						and in doing so, you are re-enforcing your commitment to achieve
						your goals. 
					</p>
					<p>
						When you go out the door to do a run, you should know what you are 
						trying to accomplish in this workout and this can occur with the help 
						of a trainer.  A trainer can help you develop a good training routine that is 
						designed to fit your needs, based on your time availability, fitness 
						level, and many other factors.  They will help you understand 
						why you are doing the training and the specific workouts you are 
						doing.  Your understanding of the process of training should help 
						your training become more efficient, as you will know the purpose 
						behind each of your workouts.

					<h5 class="text-center lead">What A Trainer Can Do For You</h5>
					<p>It is important that your training is enjoyable.  Your feedback will be 
						utilized to develop workouts that meet your specific needs.  A 
						trainer can analyze your running form and make suggestions on how 
						to improve your running economy.  Trainers can identify appropriate 
						paces for a variety of workouts and running distance.  By providing 
						helpful suggestions for race pace and race strategy, hiring a trainer
						will ensure you get the most from your training and event experience.
					</p>
					<p><span>Invest in yourself!</span>  Your time commitment and 
						race entry fee, especially for a half or full marathon, are significant. 
						You want to get the most out of your investment to have a positive 
						race experience and achieve your goals.

					<h5 class="text-center lead">Testimonials</h5>
					<p><em>"I cannot speak highly enough about Ronnie Carda and his training 
						services.  Before taking Ronnie's marathon training course, I never 
						identified as a runner. I always enjoyed running, but I considered 
						the label "runner" to be special for those who were better, faster, 
						and stronger than myself. I learned so much more than I ever 
						expected from Ronnie's course-- much of which went beyond the 
						actual process of marathon training.  He taught us how to train 
						wisely, coached us through all the needed components of 
						marathon preparation, and instilled in us a genuine love of 
						running.  Ronnie's running expertise, positive energy, 
						encouragement, and athletic ability were invaluable aspects to his 
						training services.  Ronnie trains students not just to run 
						marathons, but to become marathoners.  I currently live in NYC, 
						am now a running coach myself, and I strive to instill in my 
						students the same skills and love of running that I gained from 
						Ronnie. Ten years after taking his course, I continue to lean back 
						on the advice and guidance he gave to me as I now train for my 
						10th marathon.  Ronnie's course helped turn me into a lifelong 
						runner."</br>

					<p class="padding-10-px"><em>"I have had the pleasure and good fortune to be coached by 
						Ronnie Carda over a multi-year timeframe. His coaching style is 
						customized to the needs and goals of the runner. He factored in my 
						past performance, injury history, competitive drive and future goals 
						when putting together my training plan. The ongoing feedback from 
						him was very helpful and improved my overall performance. I started 
						as a 3:34 marathoner and my most recent accomplishment, at the age 
						of 47, was a 2:54 marathon. Ronnieâ€™s coaching, encouragement and 
						positive attitude were all instrumental in my achievements. I would 
						highly recommend you talk with Coach Carda."<br />
