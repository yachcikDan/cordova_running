			<p>As your trainer, my goal is to assist you in accomplishing your goals as a long distance runner.  
				I wish to provide you with the habits to 
				maintain good health and a high quality of life.
			</p>

			<p> An individual's training program should be a process that can be enjoyed and also provide
       			the preparation needed to complete a targeted event.  The key to achieving 
				your goals as a long distance runner is to focus on the training process.  I will 
				provide you with an educational and positive training experience that will keep 
				you participating.
