<h3>My Training Philosophy</h3>
 
<p class="pContent">Regardless of the training goal - the program and training should be a process that 
      can be enjoyed and provide the preparation needed to enjoy the event. Positive memorable 
      experiences keep people participating and my goal is that individuals will continue 
      with a running training program, even if for no other reason than to maintain good 
      health and a high quality of life. The goal of the training should also be to learn 
      about the training process, so there is a better understanding of the program design. 
      The intent is to provide an educational, as well as, a training experience.
