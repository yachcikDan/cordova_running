			<p class="sectionHeadings">My Training Philosophy</p>
		
			<p>As your trainer, my objective is to assist you in accomplishing your distance 
				running goals.  Although my focus is on training individuals for the half and full 
				marathon, I am also capable and delighted to work with individuals who may be 
				considering a move up to the 10K distance from 5K or, for that matter, figuring 
				out how to get a good start in running.  Ultimately, I wish to provide you with 
				the habits to maintain good health, a high quality of life, and promote distance 
				running as a lifelong activity.  
			</p>

			<p> An individual's training program should be a process that can be enjoyed and 
				also provide the preparation needed to complete a targeted event.  The key to 
				achieving your goals as a distance runner is to focus on the training process.  I 
				will provide you with an educational and positive training experience that will 
				keep you participating.

			<p class="sectionHeadings">Why You Should Choose Next Level Distance Running</p>
			<p><strong>Why might you need a trainer?</strong>
				There are a number of reasons that individuals obtain a trainer's assistance.  A 
				trainer can provide the needed structure or direction in your training.  A trainer 
				can provide the needed variety of training activities to help you achieve your 
				goals.  A trainer can provide the needed role of a supervisor to the training and 
				the encouragement sometimes needed to stay the course.  Hiring a trainer is a 
				commitment that you are making to yourself and in doing so, you are 
				re-enforcing your commitment to achieve your goals. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>How can a trainer help you?</strong>
				A trainer can help you develop a good training routine, one that is designed to 
				fit your needs, based on your time availability, fitness level, and many other 
				factors.  A trainer can help you understand why you are doing the training and 
				the specific workouts you are doing.  Your understanding of the process of 
				training should help your training become more efficient, as you will know the 
				purpose behind each of your workouts.  When you go out the door to do a run, 
				you should know what you are trying to accomplish in this workout and this can 
				occur with the help of a trainer.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What a trainer can do for you</strong> - A trainer can make the training more enjoyable.  
				A trainer can take your feedback and utilize this to develop workouts that meet 
				your specific needs.  A trainer can analyze your running form and make 
				suggestions on how to improve your running economy.  A trainer can identify 
				appropriate paces for a variety of workouts and running distance.  A trainer can 
				provide helpful suggestions for race pace and race strategy so you will get the 
				most from your training and event experience.
			</p>
			<p>Invest in yourself!  Your time commitment and race entry fee, especially for a 
				half or full marathon, are significant. You want to get the most out of your 
				investment to have a positive race experience and achieve your goals.
